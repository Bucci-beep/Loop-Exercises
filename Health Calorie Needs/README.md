Description: This program calculates a person's daily calorie requirements based on weight, height, age, gender, and activity level using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation.
Formula Used: 
•	Men: BMR=10×weight+6.25×height−5×age+5BMR = 10 \times \text{weight} + 6.25 \times \text{height} - 5 \times \text{age} + 5
•	Women: BMR=10×weight+6.25×height−5×age−161BMR = 10 \times \text{weight} + 6.25 \times \text{height} - 5 \times \text{age} - 161
Activity levels are factored in using multipliers ranging from 1.2 (sedentary) to 1.725 (very active).
